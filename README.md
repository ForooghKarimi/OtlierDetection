# Outlier Detection (Anomaly Detection)
> In this project I tried to detect outliers in a dataset of customers of a mall by a number of methods.
> 
> At the end I compared the result of all these methods.
> 
> The methods that I used for outlier detection are: 
* DBSCAN
* Isolation Forest
* Local Outlier Factor
* Elliptic Envelope
*  One-Class Support Vector Machines
*  Angle-based Outlier Detector (ABOD)
